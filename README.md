Here are some of the java programs I worked:
The tiltes are self explainatory for the topics....The only ones that are not clear are explained here:
a)String01-Develop a text processing tool for a language learning platform. The tool needs to compare strings, concatenate strings, and create copies of strings for various languages. 
           Implement appropriate Java functionalities.  

b)String02-Write a program in Java for String handling which performs the following: 
              i.	Checks the capacity of String Buffer objects. 
              ii.	Reverses the contents of string given on console and converts the resultant string in upper case. 
              iii.	Reads a string from console and appends it to the resultant string.
              
c)boxing-	Demonstrate boxing of primitive data types into their corresponding wrapper class objects and unbox them back to their primitive forms.
